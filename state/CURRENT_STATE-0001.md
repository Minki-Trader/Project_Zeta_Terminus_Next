# Project Zeta Terminus Next State 0001

## STATE-0001 - 2026-08-24

- Created the separate continuity project boundary from legacy Terminus commit `4c0899255c701e2c6b53e7f44457c431aef2ad76`. The project begins with a new Git history rather than cloning the legacy 728-commit and high-volume artifact surface.
- Fixed `NEXT-E01/V7` as a behavior-preserving engineering successor to B70 V6R6. V7 receives new Magic `260824701..260824706`, identity, state and evidence, while every inherited economic and causal behavior remains frozen.
- Next Live-Dev authority is `DISABLED`. Existing legacy B70 V6R6 remains the only authorized real-account owner. B75 is paused without an opened outcome until migration completion.

## STATE-0002 - 2026-08-24

- Completed the first continuity inventory at the frozen legacy commit. `lineage/legacy-files.jsonl` records all 1,475 tracked files with repository, commit, path, Git blob, SHA-256 and byte size.
- Completed the scoped research lineage requested for migration: 359 research source files, 56 human research documents and 596 summary JSON files, exactly 1,011 records in `lineage/research-lineage.jsonl`. Unknown relationships, periods and decisions remain explicitly `unknown`; later outcomes were not backfilled.
- Reorganized the human-facing record into seven economic families under `docs/lineage/`. `Pre-V1`, `Economic`, `Axis A`, `Axis B` and `Axis C` remain provenance tags rather than the table of contents.
- Fixed the executable core line in `lineage/executable-lineage.json`: `B48 -> B49/V6R2 -> B52/V6R3 -> B66/V6R4 -> B67/V6R5 -> B70/V6R6 -> NEXT-E01/V7`, with the earlier finite-risk ancestry preserved ahead of B48.
- This inventory is descriptive continuity evidence, not new profit evidence and not a promotion result. The one-time extraction code was not retained as a project CLI, validator or test harness.

## STATE-0003 - 2026-08-24

- Created physically separate `lab/` and `live-dev/` lanes. Lab junctions resolve only under `lab/`; Live static junctions resolve only under `live-dev/package/active/`. Neither lane points into the other or into legacy source.
- Froze the eight-file B70 V6R6 control under `lab/control-v6r6/`: source, EX5, SET, binding/latest INI, B70 human record, declaration JSON and validation JSON. Every SHA-256 and byte size matches the legacy anchor manifest. Bulk backtest logs and reports remain referenced rather than copied.
- Initialized the Git-ignored Lab Tester Portable with MT5 build `5.0.0.6140` and local copies of US100, US30 and US500 required history/tick caches. Source and destination counts and byte totals match for all 12 terminal/tester history and tick directories.
- Initialized only a staged Live Portable shell at build `5.0.0.6140`. It has no `Bases`, no account or broker configuration, no EA state and no runnable V7 release. No Next terminal was started.
- Gracefully stopped the legacy Lab/Tester terminal before copying its cache. The legacy B70 V6R6 Live terminal remained running and unchanged throughout.

## STATE-0004 - 2026-08-24

- Extracted B70 V6R6 into a modular V7 without introducing a strategy registry or plug-in layer. The six strategies remain six explicit modules and six explicit calls; the main EA now owns only assembly and inherited event ordering.
- Made `ComponentDefinition`, `ComponentState`, `PortfolioState`, `ExecutionState` and `DecisionIntent` real runtime state owners. The original fields and persistence order remain behaviorally inherited; current snapshot and event records add only `schema_version`, `release_id` and `project_id` identity fields.
- Fixed candidate identity from a normalized final source/settings tree: canonical SHA-256 `2db5ef5ead1c68e6f596f78726adcc9d622ec4f58868451aec11a68a5748578e`, release `NEXT-E01-V7-2db5ef5ead1c`, Portfolio ID `ZT-PORT-NEXT-V7-2db5ef5ead1c`, Magic `260824701..260824706`.
- Preserved the B70 SET byte-for-byte and changed only Expert, preset and report identities in the two tester INIs. Their non-identity settings match B70 exactly for binding `2022-08-01` through completed `2026-08-20` and latest `2026-06-01` through `2026-07-31`.
- MetaEditor build `5.0.0.6140` compiled the 14-module source tree with `0 errors / 0 warnings`. Candidate EX5 SHA-256 is `0A722406921F76259E4828D87915C2BA6F2F345A4059CC310EEC4BC446011B53`.
- Compilation is engineering evidence only. Fixed-window V6R6/V7 real-tick equality is still pending, so this candidate is not promoted and Next Live remains `DISABLED`.
